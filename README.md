Hello! I'm Andriy Krupych and here go my explantions about things used in this dev test app:
- Kotlin is my choise for it's much more robust then Java;
- Retrofit is for the communication with API + it has RxJava support, which makes communication simpler;
- RxJava is used for retrieving data from server and delivering RecyclerView's clicks;
- Glide stands for image loading.

I could have done the project smaller, but I've tried to show up what would I use in the real-life project.
